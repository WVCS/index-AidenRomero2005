  <h1> Reason #1: He's very powerful </h1>
  <p> He's once created a whole new world and universe because he had to save everyone because the multiverse was being destroyed. He created his own world and reality where he was God and had godlike powers. <p>
  <p> He was once the Sorcerer Supreme, a Ghost Rider and The Iron Fist all at the same time (which is [if you don't know] the powers of Doctor Strange, Ghost Rider, and Iron Fist). <p>

  <h4> He is way smarter than most of the Marvel Universe, for example he's smarter than Iron Man. <h4>
    <p> His rival, Reed Richards (AKA Mr. Fantastic) is considered the smartest man in the world, Iron Man said that, and half the time Doom outsmarts Reed but is taken down because of plot. <p>
