    <h1> Reason #2: His motives <h1>
      <p> Doom is very smart and he relies on his smarts and science to achieve his goals, He's well versed in magic but uses it when he's struggling. For the most part he likes to challenge himself by only using technology.<p>
      <p> He's the ruler of a Country so he cares for his people and he truly does care for the earth. </p>
      <h2> He's become such a genius and so powerful for multiple reasons but one of the biggest one's is his mother. </h2>
      <p> Back when he was growing up and learning magic, he summoned demons to duel. One time he summoned the Devil himself, Mephisto. Mephisto agreed to a duel in exchange for his mother's soul if he won. Mephisto won and he hold's his mothers soul captive in hell. </p>
      <p> Victor von Doom (Doctor Doom) was devastated and he swore to bring his mother back at any means necessary </p>
      <h3> He is quite the jealous type </h3>
      <p> One of the main reason's he hates Reed Richards is because Reed is the smartest man, Victor knows that and is jealous and wishes to be rid of reed. Victor believes he can lead the world </P>
